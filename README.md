# Java-Sprint-Boot-CRUD

A Java Spring Boot backend app that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations is a web application that allows you to create, read, update, and delete data from a database. The app is built using the Spring Boot framework, which provides a set of tools and libraries for building scalable and robust web applications.

The CRUD operations are implemented using RESTful APIs, which provide a standard way of accessing and manipulating resources over the internet. The app exposes endpoints for each CRUD operation, and these endpoints are mapped to specific HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) based on the operation being performed.

The app connects to a database using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, such as Hibernate or MyBatis, which allows it to interact with the database using Java objects. The data is stored in a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and is accessed using SQL queries.

Overall, a Java Spring Boot backend app that performs CRUD operations is a powerful tool for building data-driven web applications that can scale to handle large volumes of data and user
